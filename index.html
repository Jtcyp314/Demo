<!--
Name: Tea Après-Midi

What they do: Caller/delivery service that curates tea based on user preferences and general seasonal teas. Teas are deliverd to their homes.

Target demographic: Anyone who likes tea but doesn't have time to go shopping and try out new teas.

Easiest part: The actual coding of the HTML for the website

Hardest part: Coming up with an idea that is reasonable enough to warrent a website and is something that I know enough about to make a full website on.-->
