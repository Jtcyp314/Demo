    We know here at Tea Après-Midi that in your busy life it can be hard to find time to drink tea, nonetheless choose which one. That is why we curate monthly teas that we think you'd enjoy, so you can focus on one thing, yourself.

    We understand that tea is more than just a drink for the afternoon (although that is when we love to drink it). That is why we partnered with tea farms that are leading the industry with sustainable tea growing methods. That way you both your conscience and mouth can feel good. Along with this partnership, we have teamed up with some of the industry's best tea scientists: buckle up tastebuds, you're in for a treat.
